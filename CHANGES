Release v0.2.9
    * Preprocessor:
        - __VA_ARGS__ support
        _ __VA_ARGS__ indexing
        - Predefined macros like __DATE__, __TIME__, ...
          (check the manpage for a full list)
        - Signed numbers as single token in the
        - Fixes some issues with #if operations on macros.
        - Speed improvements
    * Language:
        - Untyped `nil` keyword.
        - Removed the `noreturn` keyword.
        - Added generic attribute syntax and reintroduced `noreturn`
          as [[noreturn]].
        - Added [[deprecated]] and [[deprecated("message")]].
        - Support for `static` variables in functions.
        - Support for labeled loops.
        - UTF-8 Support
        - enum support: without enum-types
          (ie no `typedef enum { } foo;`)
        - Accessing vector components via the dot operator on all
          expressions. Eg: (3 * v).y
        - Type restricted variadict parameters:
          ie: void print(string...);
        - Accessing varargs from QC via: ...(index, type)
        - New operators: ** (exponentiation), % (modulo), etc
        - Enumeration attributes: flag, reverse
    * Compilation:
        - Various optimizations and progs-size reductions.
        - A new spell-checking algorithm tries to hint you at existing
          variables on error.
        - Some problems with VM related vector-instructions issues
          have been solved in both DP and our own executor. A new
          compatbility option (enabled by default) has been added for
          now: -flegacy-vector-maths
        - Compiler intrinsics: __builtin_floor, __builtin_mod,
        __builtin_exp, __builtin_isnan
        - Improved memory tracing
        - Speed improvements
    * QCVM:
        - Improved commandline argument handling.
        - More builtins: sqrt(), normalize()
    * Commandline:
        - Nicer memory dumps
        - Support for making individual warnings an error
        - via -Werror-<warning>
        - added --add-info
    * Testsuite:
        - Support for QCFLAGS to run tests with several additional
          flags.
        - Added support for preprocessor tests
        - Added preprocessor tests
        - Added defs.qh (auto included) for qcvm definitions
    * Syntax Highlighting:
        - Added various syntax highlighting description files for
        various text editors / integrated development envirorments,
        including support for: geany, kate, kwrite, kdevelop, QtCreator,
        gtksourceview, gedit, sany, nano, jedit
    * Build:
        - Build scripts for building debian, archlinux and archbsd
        packages for x86, and x86_64.
        - Makefile targets for gource visualization, and render of
          gource visualization.
