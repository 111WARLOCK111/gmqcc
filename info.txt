there are 3 accessible memory zones -
globals:
  array of 32bit ints/floats, mixed, LE,
entities:
  structure is up to the engine but the fields are a linear array
  of mixed ints/floats, there are globals referring to the offsets
  of these in the entity struct so there are ADDRESS and STOREP and
  LOAD instructions that use globals containing field offsets.
strings:
  a static array in the progs.dat, with file parsing creating
  additional constants, and some engine fields are mapped by 
  address as well to unique string offsets
