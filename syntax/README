Here exists some syntax highlighting configuration files for various
text editors. Inside each directory exists some documentaiton on how
you can install the configuration file correctly.

Currently the supported text editors:
    geany
    kate
    kwrite    - uses kate syntax highlightin)
    kdevelop  - uses kate syntax highlighting
    QtCreator - supports kate syntax highlighting
    nano


Other text editors we plan to provide syntax highlighting configuration
files for (but never got around to figuring out)
    vim
    emacs
    gedit

If your text editor is not supported and you'd like to create syntax
highlighting support for it, don't hesitate to share it with us.
