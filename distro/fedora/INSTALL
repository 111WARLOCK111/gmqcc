To use the spec files in this fedora directory you need the core
development tools for Fedora, building enviroment for the user, and
the directory structure for it. If you don't already have these, issue
the following commands.

# yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
# yum install rpmdevtools
# rpmdev-setuptree

Now, depending on the version of GMQCC you want, there are a serise of
maintained spec files in this directory. Chose the version you want and
issue the following to build the RPM.

# rpmbuild -bs gmqc-[[version]].spec

This will create an rpm file in the working directory, which you can
install with the rpm command line tool or mock.
